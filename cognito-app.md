Perfect! Here's a **project-based roadmap to learn AWS Cognito**, using the same style and project as with Keycloak — but adapted to Cognito’s approach to identity and access management.

---

## 🧩 **Project: "MyTasks" – A Task Management Dashboard**

### 🧱 Stack

- **Frontend**: React (or Next.js)
    
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) or Spring Boot
    
- **Auth**: AWS Cognito
    
- **Extras**: REST API, protected routes, role-based UI
    

---

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Cognito Setup & Login Flow**

### 🎯 Goal: Set up Cognito and enable login from the frontend

#### Tasks:

1. Go to [AWS Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
    
2. Create a **User Pool** (e.g., `MyTasksUsers`)
    
3. Create an **App Client** with:
    
    - No client secret (for public clients like React)
        
    - Enable Hosted UI
        
4. Configure the **App Client's callback URL** (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/`)
    
5. Create a basic React app with a "Login" button
    
6. Use [amazon-cognito-auth-js](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-auth-js) or [Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) to integrate login
    

#### ✅ You’ll Learn:

- Cognito User Pools
    
- Hosted UI login
    
- App client configuration
    

---

## 🔐 **Phase 2: Protect Routes + Get User Info**

### 🎯 Goal: Authenticate users and access their details

#### Tasks:

1. After login, store the tokens (ID, access, refresh)
    
2. Show user info (username, email)
    
3. Protect `/dashboard` route
    
4. Add logout functionality
    

#### ✅ You’ll Learn:

- Cognito tokens (ID token = user info)
    
- React route protection
    
- Amplify or raw Cognito JS SDK usage
    

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Phase 3: Roles & Role-Based UI**

### 🎯 Goal: Differentiate between users and admins in the UI

#### Tasks:

1. In Cognito, define **Groups**: `admin`, `user`
    
2. Assign users to groups via the AWS Console or CLI
    
3. In the frontend:
    
    - Decode ID token
        
    - Check `cognito:groups` claim
        
    - Show/hide UI elements based on role
        

#### ✅ You’ll Learn:

- Cognito Groups = RBAC
    
- Using JWT claims to control UI
    

---

## 🌐 **Phase 4: Secure Backend API with Cognito**

### 🎯 Goal: Protect API endpoints using access tokens from Cognito

#### Tasks:

1. Create a Node.js or Spring Boot backend
    
2. Secure `/tasks` endpoint
    
    - Only users with valid access token can read
        
    - Only admins can POST/DELETE
        
3. Validate the **JWT access token** using:
    
    - Node.js: `jsonwebtoken`, `jwks-rsa`
        
    - Java: Cognito-compatible JWT validator or Spring Security
        

#### ✅ You’ll Learn:

- Cognito JWT structure
    
- Validating access tokens server-side
    
- Role-based access in the backend via groups
    

---

## 🧪 **Phase 5: Token Management & Refresh**

### 🎯 Goal: Understand and implement token refresh

#### Tasks:

1. Log ID/access tokens and decode on [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
    
2. Implement refresh using Cognito’s refresh token
    
3. (Optional) Use Amplify Auth’s built-in session refresh
    

#### ✅ You’ll Learn:

- Token lifetimes (Cognito default: 1hr access, 1 day refresh)
    
- How to refresh sessions
    
- Secure token handling
    

---

## 🎨 **Phase 6: Custom Login & Social Sign-In**

### 🎯 Goal: Style login and add social login (e.g., Google)

#### Tasks:

1. Customize the Hosted UI (you can inject CSS/branding)
    
2. Enable **Google** as an Identity Provider:
    
    - Create OAuth app on Google
        
    - Connect it to Cognito Identity Provider
        
3. Map Google users to Cognito Groups automatically (optional)
    

#### ✅ You’ll Learn:

- Cognito Identity Federation
    
- Hosted UI customization
    
- Social login via OAuth
    

---

## 📦 **Phase 7: Deployment & Environment Config**

### 🎯 Goal: Bundle everything for cloud deployment

#### Tasks:

1. Deploy frontend and backend (e.g., Vercel + ECS/Fargate)
    
2. Use **environment variables** for:
    
    - Cognito user pool ID
        
    - App client ID
        
    - Redirect URLs
        
3. Secure API Gateway or Lambda endpoints with Cognito Authorizer (optional but cool)
    

---

## 🏁 Result: You’ll Have Built…

An auth-enabled app using AWS Cognito:

- Secure login with user groups (admin/user)
    
- Role-based UI
    
- Protected API with token verification
    
- Optional Google login
